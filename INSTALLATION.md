# Installation Guide

This guide will help you set up and use the Nx Code Coverage Action in your repository.

## Quick Setup

### 1. Basic Setup

Add the action to your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Generate coverage report
  uses: your-username/nx-code-coverage@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    coverage-folder: './coverage'
    coverage-base-folder: './coverage-base'
```

### 2. Set Required Permissions

Ensure your workflow has the necessary permissions:

```yaml
jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write  # Required for commenting on PRs
      contents: read        # Required for reading repository content
```

### 3. Prepare Coverage Data

Organize your coverage files in a nested directory structure:

```
coverage/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lcov.info
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ coverage-summary.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ backend/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ lcov.info
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ coverage-summary.json
â””â”€â”€ libs/
    â””â”€â”€ shared/
        â”œâ”€â”€ lcov.info
        â””â”€â”€ coverage-summary.json
```

## Advanced Setup

### With Base Coverage Comparison

```yaml
- name: Download base coverage
  uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v6
  continue-on-error: true
  with:
    workflow: ci.yml
    branch: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref || 'main' }}
    name: coverage-base
    path: ./coverage-base

- name: Generate coverage report
  uses: your-username/nx-code-coverage@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    coverage-folder: './coverage'
    coverage-base-folder: './coverage-base'
    minimum-coverage: 80
    hide-unchanged: true
```

### With Custom Configuration

```yaml
- name: Generate coverage report
  uses: your-username/nx-code-coverage@v1
  with:
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    coverage-folder: './coverage'
    coverage-base-folder: './coverage-base'
    minimum-coverage: 85
    comment-title: 'ðŸ“Š Test Coverage Report'
    hide-coverage-reports: false
    hide-unchanged: true
    update-comment: true
    include-summary: true
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No coverage files found**
   - Verify your coverage files are in the expected locations
   - Check that files are named correctly (`lcov.info` or `coverage-summary.json`)

2. **Permission denied errors**
   - Ensure your workflow has `pull-requests: write` permission
   - Check that the GitHub token has sufficient permissions

3. **Coverage parsing errors**
   - Verify LCOV and JSON files are properly formatted
   - Check the action logs for specific parsing errors

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the [troubleshooting section](README.md#troubleshooting) in the README
2. Review the [examples](examples/) directory
3. Open an issue on GitHub with:
   - Your workflow configuration
   - Error logs
   - Sample coverage files (if possible)
